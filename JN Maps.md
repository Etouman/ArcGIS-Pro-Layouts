# The Estuary of Cameroon
This way of representing data in 3D, using satellite images and terrain models, is breathtaking. From this cartographic representation, we can explore the Cameroon estuary in its entirety, the relief, hydrography and urban sprawl of nearby major cities. This work has enabled me to realize just o small part of the enormous potential of ArcGIS Pro, and I feel ready to discover even more. 

- Tools : Copernicus DEM 30m

# Cameroon Travel Map: Road to Moloundou
I’d like to share with you a travel map for those who want to get to Moloundou, in the East Region of Cameroon. My starting point is Yaoundé, capital of Cameroon. During the trip, you’ll discover places and territories that should please you, such as the cobalt mines of Lomié, the equatorial forest of Yokadouma, or the Pygmies encampment near Moloundou.
